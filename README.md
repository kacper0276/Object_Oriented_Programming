# Object_Oriented_Programming

Object_Oriented_Programming is a repository focused on object-oriented programming in Java. It includes examples and exercises that cover the syntax of the Java language and fundamental concepts such as objects, classes, strings, constructors, and interfaces.

## Description

This repository provides examples and solutions for:
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implementations of object-oriented programming principles using Java.
- **Java Syntax**: Understanding the syntax and structure of the Java programming language.
- **Objects and Classes**: Basics of creating and using objects and classes in Java.
- **Strings**: Working with string data and manipulating string values.
- **Constructors**: Implementing constructors for initializing objects.
- **Interfaces**: Defining and using interfaces to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.

## Technologies

- **Java**: The programming language used for object-oriented programming examples and exercises.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kacper0276/Programowanie_Obiektowe.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Programowanie_Obiektowe
    ```

3. **Compile the Java code**:
    - You can use the `javac` command to compile Java files. For example:
      ```bash
      javac filename.java
      ```
    - Replace `filename.java` with the specific file you want to compile.

4. **Run the compiled Java program**:
    ```bash
    java classname
    ```
    - Replace `classname` with the name of the class containing the `main` method.
